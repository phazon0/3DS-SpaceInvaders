For debugging crash on the 3ds

//OFFLINE 
since oreo639 helped me, i will just summerize for noobs like me:
start msys2
do cd to the folder of your .elf of the homebrew application (on pc)
write $DEVKITARM/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb and then your-apps-name.elf
now go into homebrew menu or where you launch it from
open rosalina menu by L+down+select
go to debugger options->Enable Debugger and Force-debug next application on launch
make note of the port, and check the ip in the right top corner
Go out of rosalina menu
Start your app
Go to your pc and in msys2/terminal do target remote ip:port
it should say something like 0x00100000 in _start ()
then write c and hit enter
write backtrace or bt
